# neilpiper.me Parent POM file

 
## What this is?

Source code for the parent pom for the Organisation

'neilpiper.me'

# How to use the Parent POM?

## Conventions to follow?

Repository is in Github team.

project.name = GIT repository name

Use git issue tracking (default)

When using `site` put published version into github pages as path `${project.name}`

## Why not test frameworks?

Allow freedom, suggest JUnit by default.

Also consider: 
* Powermock
* Mockito


## Overiding key behaviours?

# Release Baselining (Maven snapshots, releases)

Release versions are baselined into an S3 Bucket owned by 
solveapuzzledev.  The extension [maven-s3-wagon](https://github.com/jcaddel/maven-s3-wagon) is used to communicate to S3.  

The build server will need authentication/authorisation to the S3 bucket to do this.

## Release process

Use semantic versioning in your POM file to consider a release candidate of the change you are intending to make, and the CI server to guid the succesful build candidate to take forward.

Why: You know the change you are after,.. it might take a few builds and tests to get it so the code traceability is always built in.

```
mvn deploy scm:tag -Drevision=${GIT-SHORT-TAG}
```
